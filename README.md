# DSA_Visualizer
This will involve visualization of the most common algorithms and data structures, such as sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, etc.) and tree insertion algorithms(red-black, binary, etc.). Our website will also be able to simulate data structures so that users can view the effects of adding and removing data from them.
